<span style="color:black;">**ITHindex**</span> (intra-tumor heterogeneity[ITH] index) is a interactive web tool dedicated to ITH quantification by using various measurements based on the profiling of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic features from single/multi-regional sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, or single-cell sequencing.

Within ITHindex, users can quickly get the various ITH metrics by different algorithms, including genetic heterogeneity, transcriptomic heterogeneity, proteomic heterogeneity and epigenetic heterogeneity, assisting researchers in further investigating the mechanism of tumor progression, metastasis and improving clinical decision-making.
