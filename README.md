# ITHindex

ITHindex (intra-tumor heterogeneity[ITH] index) is a interactive web tool dedicated to ITH quantification by using various measurements based on the profiling of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic features from single/multi-regional sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, or single-cell sequencing.

Within ITHindex, users can quickly get the various ITH metrics by different algorithms, including genetic heterogeneity, transcriptomic heterogeneity, proteomic heterogeneity and epigenetic heterogeneity, assisting researchers in further investigating the mechanism of tumor progression, metastasis and improving clinical decision-making.

Key Points:

- ITHindex integrate multiple algorithms for the quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity.

- ITHindex can be used to evaluate multi-level ITH based on multi-omics data.

- ITHindex provide a user-friendly platform for researchers to investigate the role of ITH in oncologic biology.
